## About the project

The website features several interesting resources and functionalities. Let's highlight each of them:

1. Homepage: Your homepage offers an attractive and engaging introduction to visitors.

2. Simple Backend: The backend of your site is developed efficiently and functionally.

3. Product CRUD: The implementation of a small-scale product CRUD is a valuable addition to your site. It allows users to easily and intuitively view, add, edit, and delete products. This is particularly useful for online stores or any site involving inventory management.

4. Settings Page: The inclusion of a settings page with various components is an excellent way to enable users to personalize their site experience.

5. Attempted informative blog about the Amazon: Although created hastily, your informative blog about the Amazon is a valuable addition to your site. It provides relevant information about the region, highlighting environmental issues, the diversity of fauna and flora, and the importance of preservation. This section can be expanded in the future, offering more resources and content to interested visitors.

## ðŸš€ Hello, Hahn Software!
Team Hahn Software,

I am Kelvin, a software developer from Project Samsung at the Center for Informatics (CIn) of the Federal University of Pernambuco. I apologize for the delay in submitting this project, but it was due to the contractual protection of all my projects to date. I had only a few days to complete it and try to validate it. Additionally, I had some issues with my machine, but everything is sorted now as I have purchased a new one, and I am back up and running smoothly.

Thank you for your understanding. I am available to discuss any aspect of the project, and I hope it meets your expectations.

Best regards,

Kelvin,
Software Developer

## Clone and Install a Branch

This guide outlines the process to clone and install a specific branch from a Git repository on your computer.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Open the terminal or command prompt on your computer.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. For example, you can use the `cd` command to enter the desired folder.

3. In the terminal, type the following command to clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository URL>
   ```

   Replace `<repository URL>` with the URL of the Git repository that contains the branch you want to clone.

4. Once the clone is complete, navigate to the repository directory using the `cd` command.

5. Check the available branches in the repository using the `git branch` command.

6. To switch to the branch you want to install, use the following command:

   ```
   git checkout <branch name>
   ```

   Replace `<branch name>` with the name of the branch you want to install.

7. Now that you are on the desired branch, install the project dependencies using the `npm install` command. This will ensure that all necessary dependencies are downloaded and installed correctly.

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your computer before running this command.

8. After the `npm install` command completes, you are ready to proceed with configuring, running, or editing the project as needed.

Remember to replace `<repository URL>` and `<branch name>` with the specific information relevant to your case.
