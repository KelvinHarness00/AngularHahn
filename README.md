## ðŸš€ Hello, Hahn Software!
Team Hahn Software,

I am Kelvin, a software developer from Project Samsung at the Center for Informatics (CIn) of the Federal University of Pernambuco. I apologize for the delay in submitting this project, but it was due to the contractual protection of all my projects to date. I had only a few days to complete it and try to validate it. Additionally, I had some issues with my machine, but everything is sorted now as I have purchased a new one, and I am back up and running smoothly.

Thank you for your understanding. I am available to discuss any aspect of the project, and I hope it meets your expectations.

Best regards,

Kelvin,
Software Developer
